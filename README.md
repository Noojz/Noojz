I was born in the United Kingdom, relocated to Australia when I was three years old, and then to Canada. Technology has always been a huge part of my life since I wasÂ young. I'll be attending a technology-focused high school next year. At the moment, I'm working on a Discord bot that will make setting up a Discord server simple for new members. But before I can accomplish this, I need to learn JavaScript.
